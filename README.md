Welcome to the Chocolate Brewery System!
A console-based Java application that simulates a chocolate production environment. Manage ingredients, recipes, production, and customer orders — all in one system.


🚀 Features

Ingredient Management:
Add, track, and update ingredients in inventory.

Recipe Management:
Create, store, update, and remove chocolate recipes with required ingredients and output quantity.

Production Area:
Produce chocolate batches based on recipes, checking inventory and updating chocolate bars automatically.

Customer Orders:
Take orders from customers and process them using the production system.

Order Manager:
Maintain a list of orders, process them sequentially, and display completed orders.

Inventory Tracking:
Automatically deduct ingredients used and update chocolate bar stock after production.


📋 How It Works

Add Ingredients to the system (e.g., cocoa, sugar, milk).

Create Recipes specifying ingredients and chocolate output.

Take Customer Orders including recipe choice and quantity.

Process Orders using the production area — system checks inventory and produces chocolate.

Update Inventory automatically and display completed orders.


🛠️ Technologies Used
